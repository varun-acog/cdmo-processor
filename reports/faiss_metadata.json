Disposal considerations\nThe generation of waste should be avoided or minimized wherever possible.  Disposal \nof this product, solutions and any by-products should at all times comply with the \nrequirements of environmental protection and waste disposal legislation and any \nregional local authority requirements.  Dispose of surplus and non-recyclable products \nvia a licensed waste disposal contractor.  Waste should not be disposed of untreated to \nthe sewer unless fully compliant with the requirements of all authorities with jurisdiction.\nWaste packaging should be recycled.  Incineration or landfill should only be considered \nwhen recycling is not feasible.  This material and its container must be disposed of in a \nsafe way.  Empty containers or liners may retain some product residues.  Avoid \ndispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains and \nsewers.\n:Disposal methods\nDisposal should be in accordance with applicable regional, national and local laws and regulations. Local \nregulations may be more stringent than regional or national requirements.\nThe information presented below only applies to the material as supplied. The identification based on \ncharacteristic(s) or listing may not apply if the material has been used or otherwise contaminated. It is the \nresponsibility of the waste generator to determine the toxicity and physical properties of the material generated to \ndetermine the proper waste identification and disposal methods in compliance with applicable regulations.\nRefer to Section 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE and Section 8: EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION \nfor additional handling information and protection of employees.\n13.1 Waste treatment methods\nSection 14.

Workers should wash hands and face before eating,\ndrinking and smoking.  Remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment before \nentering eating areas.  See also Section 8 for additional information on hygiene \nmeasures.\nStore in accordance with local regulations.  Store in original container protected from \ndirect sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area, away from incompatible materials \n(see Section 10) and food and drink.  Keep container tightly closed and sealed until \nready for use.  Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed and kept \nupright to prevent leakage.  Do not store in unlabeled containers.  Use appropriate \ncontainment to avoid environmental contamination.

Respirators must be used according to a \nrespiratory protection program to ensure proper fitting, training, and other important \naspects of use.\nChemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be \nworn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is \nnecessary.\nSafety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk \nassessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,\ngases or dusts.  If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless \nthe assessment indicates a higher degree of protection:  safety glasses with side-\nshields.\nEye/face protection\nRespiratory protection:\n:\n:\nBody protectionPersonal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being \nperformed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before \nhandling this product.\n:\nEnvironmental exposure \ncontrols\n:Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure \nthey comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation.  In some \ncases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment \nwill be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.\nAppropriate engineering \ncontrols\n:Good general ventilation should be sufficient to control worker exposure to airborne \ncontaminants.\nWash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before \neating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.\nAppropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.\nWash contaminated clothing before reusing.  Ensure that eyewash stations and safety \nshowers are close to the workstation location.\nHygiene measures:\n8.1 Control parameters\nIndividual protection measures\nOccupational exposure limits\nSkin protection\nOther skin protection:Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected \nbased on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a \nspecialist before handling this product.\n8.2 Exposure controls\nSection 9.
