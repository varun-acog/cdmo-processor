Disposal considerations\nThe generation of waste should be avoided or minimized wherever possible.  Disposal \nof this product, solutions and any by-products should at all times comply with the \nrequirements of environmental protection and waste disposal legislation and any \nregional local authority requirements.  Dispose of surplus and non-recyclable products \nvia a licensed waste disposal contractor.  Waste should not be disposed of untreated to \nthe sewer unless fully compliant with the requirements of all authorities with jurisdiction.\nWaste packaging should be recycled.  Incineration or landfill should only be considered \nwhen recycling is not feasible.  This material and its container must be disposed of in a \nsafe way.  Empty containers or liners may retain some product residues.  Avoid \ndispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains and \nsewers.\n:Disposal methods\nDisposal should be in accordance with applicable regional, national and local laws and regulations. Local \nregulations may be more stringent than regional or national requirements.\nThe information presented below only applies to the material as supplied. The identification based on \ncharacteristic(s) or listing may not apply if the material has been used or otherwise contaminated. It is the \nresponsibility of the waste generator to determine the toxicity and physical properties of the material generated to \ndetermine the proper waste identification and disposal methods in compliance with applicable regulations.\nRefer to Section 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE and Section 8: EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION \nfor additional handling information and protection of employees.\n13.1 Waste treatment methods\nSection 14.
